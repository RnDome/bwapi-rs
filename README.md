# About

This project is an attempt to create idiomatic Rust bindings to the [BWAPI library](http://bwapi.github.io/).

The main goal is to provide convenient API which will someday allow writing custom bots for the legendary Starcraft/Broodwar game in the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Please note however, that this project is absolutely nothing to do with Starcraft 2.

As you've probably noticed, the project is in it's very early days of development. Actually, we have no idea how it would work. The future will tell.
